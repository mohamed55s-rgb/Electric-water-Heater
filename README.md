# Electric-water-Heater
The Electric water heater project is a project made by ATmega32 and by using Atmel studio as a coding software and also by using protues as a simulation software as well which is used to make this simulation is the :- Seven segmants , Timers , Buttons , Leds as well 
The macinsm of the project was based on the following as a general way :
  If power is connected to the heater, the electric water heater is in OFF state 
 If the “ON/OFF” button is released and the electric water heater is in OFF state, 
the electric water heater goes to ON state 
 If the “ON/OFF” button is released and the electric water heater is in ON state, 
the electric water heater goes to OFF state 
 In the OFF state, all display should be turned OFF 
 The initial set temperature is 60 degrees 
 The minimum possible set temperature is 35 degrees
The maximum possible set temperature is 75 degrees
